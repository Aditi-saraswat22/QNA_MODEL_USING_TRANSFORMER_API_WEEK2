# QNA_MODEL_USING_TRANSFORMER_API_WEEK2
A context-aware generative question answering system built using Hugging Face’s FLAN-T5 model. The project takes user-provided text as context and generates natural language answers with clear reasoning, handling “why” and comparative questions better than traditional extractive QA systems.
